# Domain-Specific-IR-System-for-Legal-Document-Retrieval-with-Intelligent-Query-Expansion
This project focuses on developing a domain-specific Information Retrieval system especially designed for Pakistan legal documents. The main purpose of this system is to address the limitations of traditional keyword search when it is applied on legal text. Legal writing normally contains technical vocabulary, formal expressions, and specific terminology, which are difficult to retrieve using simple keyword matching. Therefore, this system aims to improve legal search by applying text preprocessing, query expansion, and semantic matching in order to make the retrieval process more effective for real legal language.

This project was jointly built by Momna Waryam Khan (MSCS25011) and Talal Ahmad (MSCS25015) as part of our course work. Together, we implemented every step of the pipeline including dataset loading procedures, preprocessing functions, and TF-IDF based indexing. We also performed several experiments to test query expansion and search performance, and then compared results using different values of K. Our main contribution in this project was to convert theoretical IR concepts into a running practical system that works specifically for Pakistan’s legal context.

The system automatically downloads the Pakistan Law dataset from Kaggle and supports multiple file formats such as JSON, CSV, text, and Parquet. After loading the documents, the program removes table-of-contents material and extracts useful metadata such as document title and category. The text is then cleaned through stop-word removal, punctuation removal, and lemmatization so that multiple word forms are reduced into their basic form. In addition, TF-IDF vectors are built using both unigram and n-gram features, which helps in representing phrases that are commonly used in legal discourse.

After retrieval, the system displays the most relevant documents with a short preview of the content, matched word frequency, page information, and total number of lines in the document. Along with retrieval, the project also implements several standard Information Retrieval evaluation metrics including Precision@K, Recall@K, F1-Score@K, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG), Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). These metrics are commonly used in IR research and give a clear idea of both relevance and ranking quality for every search query.

Overall, this project covers the full process of an IR system including dataset loading, preprocessing, indexing, semantic query expansion, and evaluation. By applying these techniques to Pakistan legal content, the project demonstrates how domain-specific Information Retrieval can be developed and analyzed in a practical way. It also shows how IR concepts learned in theory can be implemented in code, tested, and evaluated on real legal text.
